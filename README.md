# Guest Notes App for Art Exhibitions

## Overview

The **Guest Notes App** is a React.js web application built for art exhibitions and events. Visitors can leave feedback, comments, or thoughts about artwork or the event itself. The app features real-time note submission, an admin dashboard, artwork information display, and interactive elements like confetti and toast notifications. The app also allows URL-based navigation, enabling direct access to specific exhibitions (tags) via query parameters.

_For faster implementation, the app uses WordPress posts to manage the "current exhibited" artwork information. However, you can easily customize the database setup to fit your needsâ€”whether it's SQL, Firebase, MongoDB, or any other database. For the purposes of this documentation, we assume an SQL-based setup and provide SQL examples accordingly._

## Features

- **Live Guest Notes Display**: New notes appear instantly at the top of the list.
- **Tag-Based Filtering**: Users can view guest notes for a specific exhibition or event by selecting a tag. The selected tag is reflected in the URL as a query parameter (e.g., `?tag=2`).
- **Artwork Info Display**: Each exhibition can have an associated artwork post retrieved from a WordPress blog via a REST API. This post is shown in the app's popup window.
- **Interactive Hover Effects**: Hovering over a note blurs other notes to focus on the selected one.
- **Cursor-Following Text**: Hovering over elements triggers a small text to follow the mouse cursor.
- **Form Validation**: Guests must provide an email address and accept the terms of service before submitting feedback.
- **Confetti Animation**: A confetti animation is triggered upon successful submission of a note.
- **Toast Notifications**: Progress and success/error notifications are displayed during the note submission process.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can log in to refresh the page, log out, and select artwork for specific exhibitions.
- **Dynamic Content Control**: Admins can manage which artwork is displayed in the popup through a WordPress REST API, enabling easy updates from the WordPress dashboard.
- **Tag Synchronization**: The tag dropdown in the feedback form is synchronized with the currently selected exhibition tab.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:

  - React.js
  - Styled-components for CSS-in-JS
  - React-toastify for notifications
  - React-confetti for animations
  - React Router for routing

- **Backend**:
  - WordPress REST API for artwork posts
  - MySQL for storing guest notes
  - A custom REST API for note submission and retrieval

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v12.x or higher)
- **npm** (Node package manager)

_If you follow this documentation, you will also need a WordPress blog for managing artwork posts and a backend API to handle guest notes._

### Required Database Structure

To store the guest notes, your database should have the following structure (using MySQL as an example):

```sql
CREATE TABLE guest_notes (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  tag_id INT NOT NULL,  -- Connects the note to an exhibition (tag)
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE guest_notes_tags (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  tag_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE guest_notes_cur_artwork (
  post_id INT NOT NULL,  -- Stores the current selected artwork post ID
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Database Fields:

- **`guest_notes`** table:

  - **`id`**: Auto-incremented ID for each note.
  - **`name`**: Name of the guest (optional).
  - **`email`**: Email of the guest (required).
  - **`message`**: The feedback message (required).
  - **`tag_id`**: Reference to the exhibition or event (required).
  - **`created_at`**: Timestamp of when the note was created.

- **`guest_notes_tags`** table:

  - **`id`**: Auto-incremented ID for each tag.
  - **`tag_name`**: Name of the exhibition or event.
  - **`created_at`**: Timestamp of when the tag was created.

- **`sz_guest_notes_cur_artwork`** table:
  - **`post_id`**: The WordPress post ID of the selected artwork to be displayed for the exhibition.
  - **`created_at`**: Timestamp of when the artwork selection was made.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Guest Notes App locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saphirelabs/guest-notes-app.git
cd guest-notes-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
```

Replace `https://your-backend-api.com` with the URL of your backend API that handles guest notes and artwork retrieval.

### 4. Run the Application

Once everything is set up, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Submitting Guest Notes

Guests can:

1. Enter their name (optional), email (required), and a feedback message.
2. Check the "Accept Terms of Service" box.
3. Submit the note, which will appear instantly in the guest notes section at the top of the page.

### Artwork Popup

- Admins can select an artwork via the dashboard, which will be displayed in the popup.
- The popup has two tabs:
  - **Artist Info**: Displays a QR code for the artwork.
  - **Artwork Info**: Shows the selected artwork's title, image, and content retrieved via the WordPress REST API (in this case - adjust it based on your database).

### Admin Dashboard

Admins can:

- **Select an Artwork**: Use the dashboard to choose which artwork to display from a list of WordPress posts.
- **Delete a Note by ID**: Admins can DELETE Guest Notes by clicking the corresponding "Note Delete" button in the Dashboard.
- **Log Out**: Admins can log out by clicking the "Log Out" button in the popup when logged in.

### Navigating by URL

You can navigate directly to a specific exhibition or tag using a query parameter. For example:

- `domain.com/?tag=1`: This will show the notes related to the exhibition with `id=1`.
- The selected exhibition tag is reflected in the URL, so you can easily share links that go directly to specific exhibitions.

## Backend Integration

You need to create your own API that the app will interact with. The API should provide the following endpoints:

1. **POST `/add`** - Add a new guest note

   - Expected request body:
     ```json
     {
     	"name": "Guest Name",
     	"email": "guest@example.com",
     	"message": "Feedback message",
     	"tag_id": 1
     }
     ```
   - On success, return the created note.

2. **GET `/notes/:tag_id`** - Get all guest notes for a specific tag

   - Returns a list of notes for the selected exhibition or event.

3. **GET `/tags`** - Get all available exhibition tags.

4. **POST `/save-artwork/:post_id`** - Save the selected artwork's post ID.

5. **GET `/artwork`** - Retrieve the currently selected artwork (title, content, image) for display in the popup.

## Customization

You can modify the following aspects of the app:

- **Confetti Effect**: Adjust the `react-confetti` component for different visual effects.
- **Toast Notifications**: Customize the toast notification messages and styles using `react-toastify`.

### TO DO:
